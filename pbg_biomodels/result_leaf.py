"""Shared helpers for the ``results`` leaf — a flat ``map[observable -> timeseries]``.

The batch-compare composite stores one leaf per
``(biomodel_id, sedml_job_id, simulator)``. Each leaf is a plain mapping from
observable name to its timeseries (``list[float]``):

* **UTC** jobs carry the sample times under the reserved key ``"time"``; every
  other key is an observable's trajectory (same length as ``time``).
* **repeated-task** (parameter-scan) jobs carry the swept parameter values under
  the reserved key ``"scan"``; every other key is an observable's *response
  curve* — its (reduced) value at each scan point, same length as ``"scan"``.
* **steady-state** jobs omit both axes and store each observable as a length-1
  list — the single steady-state value.

Classification is therefore purely structural: a leaf is UTC iff it has a
``"time"`` key, a parameter scan iff it has a ``"scan"`` key, else steady-state.
Keeping these accessors in one module stops the runner (which writes leaves),
the comparison Step, and the overlay viz (which both read them) from drifting
apart on the leaf format.
